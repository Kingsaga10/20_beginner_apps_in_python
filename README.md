# 20 Beginner Apps in Python

This repository is a personal challenge to build **20 beginner-friendly Python apps in 60 days** — one small project at a time. Each app lives in its own folder and can be run independently. The goal is to sharpen my Python skills through hands-on practice, explore different areas of software development, and build a solid portfolio along the way.

## Why This Project?

Learning by building is one of the most effective ways to grow as a developer. Instead of just following tutorials, this challenge focuses on solving real problems with small, manageable projects that cover different concepts such as:

- Command-line tools
- GUI apps
- File handling
- APIs
- Games
- Data processing
- and more...

## Project Structure

Each app is placed in its own folder like this:

├── app01_todo_cli/
├── app02_project_showcase_website/
├── app03_pdf_generating_app/
├── ...
└── app20_final_project/
